## Code Test/Concept Review: SharePoint Framework

In this concept, we're trying to build a *static* To Do list. 

### Task

1. Find the React component that contains the To Do list
2. Add three items to the To Do list, adding values to the Task Name and Status columns for all three items.

### Goal

The goal of this exercise is to show you can navigate a SharePoint Framework project and comprehend enough JavaScript/TypeScript to modify the correct file to add items to the To Do list.

### Submission

Preferably, you could clone this project, make the needed change to the necessary file, then push to a new GitHub repository with your answer. If that's not possible, you may submit the file with necessary changes to jcrockett@arlingtonva.us
